# Project Title: Protein Secondary Structure Prediction and Classification

## Description
This project involves predicting the secondary structures of proteins using different digitization methods and classification algorithms. The dataset contains protein IDs, sequences, and their corresponding secondary structures. Two distinct digitization methods, EIIP and CPNR, were applied, and classification processes were executed.

### EIIP Method Classification
#### Naive Bayes
- Protein secondary structures were classified using the Naive Bayes classifier.
- Performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall) were calculated.
- Classification results were visualized, and a confusion matrix was generated.

#### DVM
- Protein secondary structures were classified using the DVM classifier.
- Performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall) were calculated.
- Classification results were visualized, and a confusion matrix was generated.

### CPNR Method Classification
#### LSTM
- Protein secondary structures were classified using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
- Performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall) were calculated.
- Classification results were visualized, a confusion matrix was generated, and an ROC curve was plotted.
- ROC curves for each class were provided.

#### RNN
- Protein secondary structures were classified using the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model.
- Performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall) were calculated.
- Classification results were visualized, a confusion matrix was generated, and an ROC curve was plotted.
- ROC curves for each class were provided.
